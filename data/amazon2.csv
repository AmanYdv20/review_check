1110639433114705920,2019-03-26 20:27:30,0,0,0,@amazon You have a security issue and you don't care. Changing an email and password doesn't do anything when devices using your app are logged in. This means the thief that once had access STILL DOES until he logs out. I told you over the phone 6 times in 2 weeks and crickets..
