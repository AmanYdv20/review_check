I tried clearing cache, closing app, uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing works (shutting off my phone and restarting does not help).  While Outlook is open I will get a notice new emails have arrived and while I am looking at my inbox, they do not show up.  I found out that if I disable WifI, as soon as 4G takes over (takes a few seconds), the new emails come in.   Later in the day, emails will come in fine while I am on WiFi. Outlook has worked flawlessly for me for the last 3 years but the month or so sucked.  Quick update:  I forgot to mention that when I uninstall and reinstall, or just update it says the inbox needs to download the messages.  I will wait 5- 10 minutes and it would not update.  The inbox is empty.  As soon as I turn off the WiFi, the messages pop right in.  So the issue with my setup is, wifi is unreliable.  VW 4G works fine.",
