I only get posts from 3 to 4 days ago. Then when I go to most recent it shows 1 post then searches the entire time. I have to keep deleting & installing. Even when I install again it doesn't fix anything. All the money Facebook has & continues to rack up should allow for the app to run like a charm. I prefer using the internet version. At least I can see recent stories smh.. Takes up too much space to be so crappy! FIX YOUR ISSUES ZUCKERBERG & STAFF!,
