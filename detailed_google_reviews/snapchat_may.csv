Saving chats is really slow, even if 1 line each, quickly tapping on 6 will take ~10 seconds before actually saving (by shaded grey). This used to be instant! 2.

Never really had an issue till the update on 3/25/19. I'm unable to save my story to my memories (it'll save the story as individual snaps into the snaps category) and it doesn't populate memories ever. I have followed all instructions and sent 5 emails over the past 2 months and still no acknowledgement. This was a big feature that made me like it so much... oh, and sometimes it'll send my minute snap out of order so it's like why bother recording :(",
