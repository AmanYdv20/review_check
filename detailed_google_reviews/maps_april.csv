548332,Maps - Navigate & Explore,Sarah C,"April 7, 2019",4,complaint first map try to be helpful but the feature that suggests re-routing your drive to save time is not designed well the application requires a user to interact with the phone tap deny to dismiss a suggestion for a faster route often one that only save a couple of minute which is inconvenient at best and dangerous at worst please add an option to turn off re-routing suggestion while the car is in motion i love goole map but would prefer to stay on my chosen course most of the time having to look at and interact with my phone while driving is terrible distracted driving is a serious problem please help reduce it by giving the option to not be re-routed or at least give u the option to check a box and specify how much faster is actually worth a box re-route if faster route save minute or something five minute shaved off my travel time is not worth having to interact with my phone while i drive the pro get me where i need to go love the avoid highway option love being able to save place i likewant to visit turn by turn direction are dependable and accurate the easy access for destination review photo etc is great,"Complaint first: Maps tries to be helpful but the 'feature' that suggests rerouting your drive to save time is not designed well. The app requires a user to interact with the phone (tap 'deny') to dismiss a suggestion for a faster route (often one that only saves a couple of minutes) which is inconvenient at best and dangerous at worst.   PLEASE add an option to turn off rerouting suggestions while the car is in motion. I love google maps but would prefer to stay on my chosen course most of the time. Having to look at and interact with my phone while driving is terrible.  Distracted driving is a serious problem. Please help reduce it by giving the option to NOT be rerouted. Or at least give us the option to check a box and specify how much faster is actually worth it. ""Reroute if faster route saves 20+ minutes"" or something. Five minutes shaved off my travel time is not worth having to interact with my phone while I drive.  The Pros: - Gets me where I need to go - Love the ""avoid highways"" option - Love being able to save places I like/want to visit - Turn by turn directions are dependable and accurate - The easy access for destination reviews, photos, etc. is great.",
