I'm constantly accidentally removing songs from my playlist  because I don't swipe perfectly up or down. Sometimes if I'm just tapping a  song without looking, it will remove the song, and I don't even know that I  did it. I probably have lost 20-30 good songs and don't even know it, and  will never find them again, because of this horrible design choice, that I  know you guys hear our complaints about, but refuse to fix. Good lord, how  could something so simple be so hard to fix. Give me an option, a check in  the box or anything to enable the feature or disable it. If I can write  this big of a complaint about this one flaw, then that might give you an  idea of how frustrating this is for an end user.
