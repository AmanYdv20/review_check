Optimize your app for Android devices instead of using the view finder to record and screenshot internally. If Instagram can do it why can't you. I understand unlike iOS there are tons of devices to optimize on Android but the least you could do is start with the top tier Android phones. As a consumer thats the best advice I can give you.,
