It's not designed well for switching between google accounts. For example if you save a map to the phone, only the account it was downloaded under can use that map. (If you want to share save places information between accounts, it's best to use one account to follow the saved paces of the other account, instead of switching between accounts.) 2. Really ENJOY the ""Your Places"" menu, especially the ""Upcoming"" section which shows the places from your google calendar events!!!  3. Travel history needs to be made  useful for users and shown in a nicely formatted  monthly mileage report! Not just a timeline, but a downloadable report with each trip and the mileage.  That would be GREAT!""  Seeing visited points on a map is useless!! 4. Consistency in spoken distance measurements would help. I would prefer if it always said 1.4 miles or .5 miles. Instead of in a quarter mile, or in 800 feet. No one would be expected to know what .4 miles is, but when it says 800 feet I am thinking it is expecting me to measure.",

It was and still is an excellent gps navigation software.  The only reason I give it a 4 star is that over time, there appears to be some fraying at the seams.  1.  First, starting approximately around the time of the Oreo release, the app has bloated to the point that it now takes exceptionally long to load and it has become generally very sluggish.  It still works great once it starts.  2. Second, voice navigation over bluetooth is now partly broken (though this may be because of Oreo's issues with the older BT standards rather than the app itself).  Specifically, the voice instructions truncate over BT unless there is another app that keeps BT active (e.g. playing music via an app or running some of the apps designed to work around this problem).",
