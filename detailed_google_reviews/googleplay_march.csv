I think it's a really underrated service. But I'm discontinuing my subscription. There are a few things, the major one being the inability to download music on PC, unlike it's competitor Spotify. It's as simple as creating a desktop app for Play Music, and once that happens, I can almost guarantee I'll be back to this service. The other minor thing is the syncing between phone and web app. Adding on one will add to the other no problem, but on the phone app adding an album will add the album un-ordered, but the web app will have it ordered. As well as when you add a song from an album you already have, on the web app the rest of the album will come to the top of the 'recently added' but on mobile it won't. For someone who likes their things in sync, it's slightly annoying.  Again, I think it is a good service for a good price.
