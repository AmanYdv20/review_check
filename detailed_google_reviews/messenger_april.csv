Please give a update that extends the last seen time for about atleast 1 week. You have reduced the time from 1 day to 3 hours. I don't know why? This is the only feature, I was missing in Facebook. Even, I tried Messenger Lite , Facebook and Facebook lite. The last seen is not showing more than 3 hours. Please consider this reveiw amd update the app. And another feature that is missing is unarchiving the chat. Other than this, the app is best",
