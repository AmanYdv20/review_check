Sometimes there will be a menu option to go to artist or album and sometimes not. when it isn't there I have to waste time doing a search that the app can sometimes remember that I did and sometimes not.    3) History from one device is not consistent with history from another.    4) The equalizer is awful.    5) Playlists and their use / management is awful.    6) There is no official Google Music API and so if you are a subscriber you are stuck using this app.,
