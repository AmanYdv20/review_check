Most of the time I try to very precisely click a song's menu button and instead the app interprets it as pressing the scroll bar, causing the app to scroll to some completely unrelated part of the songs list. - I listen to some longer audio (like hours long) and trying to move forward or backward a few seconds is nearly impossible with the scroll bar and there are no button options like ""skip back 10 seconds"". - The search feature doesn't search your local catalog, just music on the internet: it would be way more helpful if that search feature worked on music that's already on the device and in the Google Play Music library.  The final straw was today when I updated the Android operating system. After the update Google Play Music no longer is able to read from my SD card; after trying many remedies nothing has worked.
