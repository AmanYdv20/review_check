Formatted text in signature does not carry over to mobile. My signature in new emails, and replies is in plain text. Creates the opposite of a seamless transition.  3. Search functionality in mobile is almost entirely pointless. Does not provide any options of where to search, and search does not index all emails, or even all of the emails in the active inbox.  4. Cannot find a way to view other people's calendars. This should be a very obvious feature that is either hidden or non-existant.  Microsoft, PLEASE update this app! I am getting notifications constantly from emails that are supposed to be being marked as read and moved to a separate folder.

Mails show up, and you can read them. I like the haptic feedback when I wipe away mails.  But I can't recommend using this as your daily driver, especially for work related mails. And the simple reason for that is that THIS APP WILL KEEP LOSING YOUR CREDENTIALS AND ACCOUNT SETTINGS.  Just when you start wondering why no more mails show up, you open the app just to realize that, yes, you have to enter your imap server address and password again.  Not only does the app not tell you it lost the credentials (a simple push notification would suffice!!) meaning you miss out on potentially days of mails (and I did), but then it's the added hassle of having to find your information again. IT departments will hate you forever.  So again, I don't recommend using the app. I don't dislike it per se. It could be faster, and better at rendering. Mails show up too big, or too small, and zooming will be disabled. But losing my credentials, again and again (my last review, which I wrote five years ago when I got my first android phone said basically the same thing) makes this app to unreliable to be a daily driver.
