Mails show up, and you can read them. I like the haptic feedback when I wipe away mails.  But I can't recommend using this as your daily driver, especially for work related mails. And the simple reason for that is that THIS APP WILL KEEP LOSING YOUR CREDENTIALS AND ACCOUNT SETTINGS.  Just when you start wondering why no more mails show up, you open the app just to realize that, yes, you have to enter your imap server address and password again.  Not only does the app not tell you it lost the credentials (a simple push notification would suffice!!) meaning you miss out on potentially days of mails (and I did), but then it's the added hassle of having to find your information again. IT departments will hate you forever.  So again, I don't recommend using the app. I don't dislike it per se. It could be faster, and better at rendering. Mails show up too big, or too small, and zooming will be disabled. But losing my credentials, again and again (my last review, which I wrote five years ago when I got my first android phone said basically the same thing) makes this app to unreliable to be a daily driver. I needs them mails.",2,the application work decently enough i have to say that mail show up and you can read mail i like the baltic feedback when i wipe away mail but i can not recommend using this a your daily driver especially for work related mail and the simple reason for that is that this application will keep losing your credential and account setting just when you start wondering why no more mail show up you open this application just to realize that yes you have to enter your map server address and password again not only doe this application not tell you this application lost the credential a simple push notification would suffice meaning you miss out on potentially day of mail and i did but then it is the added hassle of having to find your information again it department will hate you forever so again i do not recommend using this application i do not dislike this application per se it could be faster and better at rendering mail show up too big or too small and zooming will be disabled but losing my credential again and again my last review which i wrote five year ago when i got my first android phone said basically the same thing make this application to unreliable to be a daily driver i need them mail,Noyan Şahin,,
