We believe that it would be wonderful if we could block ourselves from seeing someone's story. We would like a way to no have to watch the annoying ones without not having to go through each one and unselect it. So I guess what we are asking for is a spot in the settings to where we can ""unsubscribe"" from our friends stories that we no longer want to see.",,

585796,Google Play Music,Sean Brown,"April 2, 2019",1,"The app is severely lacking in UX in a couple key areas.  - Most frustrating to me is the list of songs: why the hell is the menu button and scroll bar so close together? Most of the time I try to very precisely click a song's menu button and instead the app interprets it as pressing the scroll bar, causing the app to scroll to some completely unrelated part of the songs list. - I listen to some longer audio (like hours long) and trying to move forward or backward a few seconds is nearly impossible with the scroll bar and there are no button options like ""skip back 10 seconds"". - The search feature doesn't search your local catalog, just music on the internet: it would be way more helpful if that search feature worked on music that's already on the device and in the Google Play Music library.  The final straw was today when I updated the Android operating system. After the update Google Play Music no longer is able to read from my SD card; after trying many remedies nothing has worked. The SD card is definitely there and the files are definitely there (I can view them through the file viewer on the phone).",,
