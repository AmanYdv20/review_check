I hate the new update. I do not wish to swipe up when I have to comment now. change it back!
New update ruined the bitmoji side of the app. Cannot use Friendmoji's in snaps only available in chats now.
The new update is so confusing. Change it back please or I won't be using snapchat anymore.
The new update is not good! It will say someone opened my snap when in reality no one has yet. Along with when I open certain conversations with people it takes 2 min until the messages pop up and send! please fix soonđŸ˜’
A Few Of My Memories Would Just Not Load And They Were Completely Backed Up. It's Really Annoying But I Guess I Won't Get Them BackđŸ¤·đŸ¾â€â™€ï¸ The Person In Those Memories Died And I Really Wish That I Could See Them.
The new update isn't really compatible with Android. The version before the update was awesome. Now i wouldnt even want to open my snapchat as it looks so different and weird. Overall its not what we want. Go back to previous version.
URGENT needs updating for the GalaxyS10 and S10+ the cameras are super zoomed in due to the aspects ratio, please allow us to change what aspect ratio our images are taken in or just set it to the default 16:9 because as of right now the app is essentially unusable. please please fix this snapchat
I just updated my Snapchat and now all of my streaks are gone and i have no friends on there when I usually get about 800 views. it says everyone is unadded when it shows up it just has their name as their username. please fix !!!!
the new update mess everything up! i cant send pictures or videos, or even stickers in a chat, also i cant see what im typing, the dark theme is cute, but hopefully it can get BETTER. i can't even answer calls, i tried to uninstall but it wa sthe same thing.!
I dont understand why after I updated to the newer version that now all of a sudden my location wont work when I have it turned on.. would love to know why and how to fix it
Recent update changed the way "Friends" are displayed.... Took away Half my contacts and replaced it with "Find a Friend". Apparently Snap Chat Developers have absolutely run out of innovative and helpful updates, and decided to make life difficult. And No I will not visit Any of your sponcers links no matter how hard you try and cram them down my throat ....
Snapchat... New Update is ridiculously slow. I can't type two words or send a picture because it kicks me off. Fix this ASAP.
It crashes alot I like the app but it sometimes won't let me send messages crashes way too much and won't even let me log back in at times
Every time I log back in I can not open my memories or stories. All videos, pictures and messages are coming through delayed or unable to view and are then lost. Also my camera won't switch when I double tap the screen since the new update
the different types of font have disappeared and i now only have classic and big text. i finally have the @ though, which is probably the only good thing in this update
why does the app keep saying updating every time I log back in? c'mon fix your stuff
cant see any of my old snap videos. they are saved in memories but none of them load.
I dont like the new update, I cant use my eyes only.. plus I lost everything in there.
Terrible, the app updated itself to yet another downgraded version. Where is the trophies and dark theme?
videos wont upload in order on my story!! and it's really starting to get on my nerves.
After latest update it has problem with 18:9 ratio. The app only loads on 3/4 of screen
updated to android pie this morning, snapchat is now completly ruined. bad scaling, glitched chat screen, very frustrating
I used to love snapchat on my old phone (galaxy s6 edge+) but I recently upgraded to the s10+ and the front camera is so zoomed in that I can hardly take a selfie, let alone a picture with 2+ people. if snapchat updates so it is more compatible with my phone I would give 5 stars.
selfie not good on my Note 9. please fix the selfie quality!! and the camera overall!!
March 8th, after trying to call a lady Snapchat got an update..... that only updates while using the app, if i die, it was the Russians dont call numbers you see, even if the match app girl is cute..
Messages don't go through 90% of the time. since it's been updated
the new updates cool but the group chats are really slow and takes a minute for the messages to even show.
What just happened? Since this update (March) I can no longer save media sent in chats? Is this it now?
after updating I can't send friendbitmoji snaps with my friends.please help he with this and try to fix this asap.
Can't add to my private story

Just got back on Snapchat An It sucks! My snapchat has been updating for three whole days now. I cant even use it!
app keeps crashing on android. please optimize for oneplus 6t
My snaps don't allow me to have 2-person bitmojis after the new update, but all my friends are able to. Please help :(
new update ruined the app, stories are not even loading on mine now unless there only photos
SUPER slow and crashes every 3 seconds. I've restarted the app, uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone but nothing works. Please fix this bug.... Using app on Google pixel
When using the front camera it looks really zoomed in and won't let me zoom out any further
so, snapchat, on my device, has been 'updating' for more than 24 hours and won't let me do anything on it. its being dumb and i dont know how to fix it, i went through my device and cleaned it and made sure everything was fine, but its still slow and 'updating'
hate the new update i can no longer move things from my camera roll to my eyes only and select alot of pictures or videos at once
Hi, apparently there's a bug with the camera on Xiaomi Pocophone F1. The camera image zoom out after I take a snap. It's annoying because I can't take the perfect picture anymore. Please look into it, thanks!
new random update(i have an andriod) and i can't even save my stories or snaps anymore once i post them on my story????!?
everytime i try to open snap it crashes
doesnt look like the bugs have been fixed wen yu upload its takes agesss for it to actually go thru
why is it so hard to log in old account
I just can't use the filter when I am taking photos like the dog and the cat or the face swap
Ok but stop and freezes sometimes
Volume controls no longer work with the new app update.
keep coming up with updating loading symbol everytime I open the app. please fix urgently! have app for years now and have had no problems until now.
The new update is terrible change it back!
I can not even see my friends on it it does not work on android well it doesn't work with the As on android and the Js
New update is horrible. Keeps crashing for when I opens up a chat too fast or swipes over to see stories. This update is trash.
My video snaps have been uploading out of order. I also haven't been getting notifications when I recieved snaps.
ever since the new update a couple of days ago, my Snapchat has been nothing but lag, unable to hear some voice notes, groupchat would have delayed messages, oftenly I wouldn't be able to see someone's messages in the groupchat, also lately I've realised that I am unable to view anyones private story , fix this for s7 edge
Never had any problems with it before but these last two updates have messed it up, my time stamps are wrong (says a message was opened 5 min ago when I barely sent the message 5 seconds ago), chats take a long time to load (click on notification of a new message and often have to wait 2 min or so until the actual message shows up on the chat screen), taking longer to send messages (will type and send a message but it takes about a min or so for the message to appear in the chat)
this new update has completely ruined snapchat. it was fine as it was in the last update. I want to have my snapchat as it was in the last update so i can give it 5/5 stars. until then, a 1/5.
I enjoyed the new update until I learned that you cannot save your stories anymore, just snaps unless I'm doing something wrong. Please fix or help us understand
When I open the app, it tells me the app is updating. It has been like that for 3 days but never updates. I uninstalled it, and now it won't reinstall.
